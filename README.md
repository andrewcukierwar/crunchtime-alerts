# Crunchtime Alerts

Crunchtime Alerts is a Python-based project designed to provide real-time notifications for NBA games. It leverages the NBA API to fetch game data, calculates Elo ratings for teams, and determines the watchability of games. Alerts are sent via Slack to notify users of exciting game moments, such as close scores in the final minutes or overtime.

## Features

- **Real-time Game Data**: Fetches live NBA game data via ESPN's hidden API.
- **Elo Ratings Calculation**: Computes updated Elo ratings using FiveThirtyEight's original NBA Elo methodology for teams based on game results found using the NBA API.
- **Watchability Scores**: Determines the watchability of games based on team ratings and user preferences.
- **Slack Notifications**: Sends alerts to a Slack channel for key game moments.
- **Daily Reports**: Generates and sends a daily report of all NBA games with their watchability scores.
